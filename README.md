biot
=====

This is an ongoing port to Erlang of https://github.com/crudbetter/biot - please see for further details. Beyond feature parity with the Elixir version, the following is planned:

A directed graph visulisation of the OTP design using Elm, with communication over web socket to a cowboy endpoint. The visulisation will highlight when communications sessions are in progress, the raw ADC counts received by the `operator` and the calibrated data received by the `vdevice`.
